                    Hosted by the Queensland University of Technology, the Droid Racing Challenge is a competition where universities around Australia build their own self-driving droids that race around a track.&nbsp;Each droid incorporates computer vision that lets it avoid obstacles and drive around the course. Our first entry to this competition was in 2018, where we placed 7th out of 8 teams, however with the challenge being quite difficult, numerous teams had dropped out before the races even began. Not a bad result for our first year!&nbsp;

                <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Improving on what we learnt that year, we stepped up to the 2019 challenge with three new teams which saw veterans and enthusiasts join the race. This time around, two of our teams succeeded in placing second and third!</p>

USRC will continue to foster keen new competitors as well as alumni to compete in this challenge. We are excited to explore what the future of QUT's Droid Racing Challenge offers and look forward to competing again.

                <p>
                    Teams of six to eight build a droid either from an existing framework or from scratch. By integrating their own onboard computers, motors electronic speed control (ESC) and out provided Intel REALSENSE camera, teams design their robots to perform simple tasks as quickly as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective is to race between two colour indicated tracks to beat an opposing team, whilst also avoiding coloured obstacles. Scores are based on the teams ability to stay within the track, avoid obstacles and beat the opposing droid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Focusing on mechanical, software and electrical engineering, the competition applies and extends what is learnt at university. It offers a fun and challenging way to approach engineering while working in teams. 

                    Individuals also get the opportunity to travel to Queensland to compete in the challange.
